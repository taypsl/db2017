      "description": "Teens of Denial is a sprawling epic, jam-packed with songs within songs and ruminations on both the mundane and meaningful facets of life. The best song of the bunch is the hooky \u201cDrunk Drivers / Killer Whales,\u201d a sobering song that compares drunk drivers to, you guessed it, killer whales, but it doesn\u2019t do so in any kind of preachy way. Car Seat Headrest\u2019s mastermind, Will Toledo, makes his own faults and rationalizations abundantly clear, but advocates listening to the voice in your head: \u201cBut you know he loves you, and he doesn\u2019t mean to cause you pain. Please listen to him, it\u2019s not too late. Turn off the engine, get out of the car, and start to walk.\u201d The music itself is powerful \u2014 it\u2019s pretty by-the-book indie rock, but so well-executed, paced perfectly, and with an excellent melody. Toledo\u2019s voice is like a cross between Julian Casablancas of the Strokes and Ray Davies of the Kinks. ",

      "description": "Kanye\u2019s lyrical ability has faltered a lot since his earlier albums. He used to put a lot of thought into his verses, peppering them with humor and wit, but now it seems like he just says whatever random idea pops into his head first. That\u2019s why Chance\u2019s verse is so refreshing \u2014 it\u2019s energetic, clever, funny, and full of life. But despite Kanye\u2019s lyrical weakness, he is still unparalleled in his creative vision and the ability to execute that vision by bringing the most talented people together. \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d is Exhibit A of that vision.",

      "description": "Pinegrove has cast a spell over me. A lot of bands have that power over me, but this time it\u2019s more surprising. The group, led by 27-year-old Evan Stephens Hall of Montclair, NJ, somehow combines indie rock, emo, and roots/country music into a singular, focused sound, and it works. It doesn\u2019t work in a \u201cnovelty\u201d sort of way either \u2014 their sound feels natural, warm, lived-in. Hall\u2019s storytelling strikes a balance between situationally specific and general in a way that is instantly relatable. On \u201cOld Friends,\u201d Hall ponders his past friendships and reflects on his own role in letting them diminish. The death and funeral of one of his old friends helps him realize that he hasn\u2019t made enough time for the people he used to feel connected to. But the song\u2019s tone is not depressing, far from it. It\u2019s self-evaluating, affirming, and ultimately hopeful. It gives me chills when he realizes the value of those that are close to him: \u201cI should call my parents when I think of them / I should tell my friends when I love them.\u201d",

      "description": "So, it turns out Tame Impala is actually a natural fit for a Miguel remix. The original version of \u201cwaves\u201d is amazing in and of itself, easily one of my 5 favorite Miguel tracks. But Kevin Parker, the wizard behind Tame Impala, gives it a little more \u201coomph.\u201d The opening harmonies, which sound like they were ripped from a sun-soaked Beach Boys cut, give way to Tame Impala\u2019s signature brand of woozy, gauzy psych rock. This seamless Miguel/Tame Impala combination hits my sweet spot dead on \u2014 so much so that I used it to soundtrack a video of my family\u2019s summer vacation, which you can enjoy below.",

Ocean\u2019s ability to create a thick, fully realized atmosphere in the studio is enough to put him in the upper echelon of songwriters, but then he has that extraordinary voice to top it off. He\u2019s a talented dude. The song then gives way to an absolutely stunning chorus of Franks singing \u201cI, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave.\u201d It\u2019s one of those musical moments that makes you stop in your tracks and pause to take in the beauty.",

      "description": "The best feeling is having no expectations and then discovering a song that blows you away. \u201cNo Woman\u201d by Whitney did that for me. Whitney are from Chicago in 2016, but they would be totally at home in Southern California in 1970. \u201cNo Woman\u201d sounds like a more lilting, laid-back \u201cVentura Highway\u201d by America, or a cousin of Seals & Crofts\u2019 \u201cSummer Breeze\u201d. The throwback sound makes sense when you learn that it was produced by Jonathan Rado, a true 60\u2019s enthusiast as a part of Foxygen. Everything sounds great, from the jumping bass to the acoustic chords and electric frills, from the strings to the horns, from the understated percussion to the thin (even with double-tracking) but beautifully yearning vocals. There are so many pieces and instruments, but at no point does it sound like too much. They add and subtract instruments at just the right time.",

The second is in the second chorus, when we first hear those horns \u2014 a perfectly-used sample of Outkast\u2019s \u201cSpottieOttieDopaliscious\u201d (by the way, this is our second reference to the incredible Outkast song on this list, see #17 for the other one). \u201cAll Night\u201d is a heartening piece of slow-burning, sumptuous soul.

On \u201cCrying in Public,\u201d by the indie pop duo Chairlift, Caroline Polacheck sings, \u201cSorry I\u2019m crying in public this way / I\u2019m falling for you, I\u2019m falling for you.\u201d Polacheck describes what inspired the lyrics: \u201cWhen I wrote these lyrics, I was just entering into a relationship with someone that I was trying to hold at arm\u2019s length and not really acknowledge it as a serious relationship. The song is about one of the many moments of forgiveness and patience and understanding that he showed me when I completely had my head in the sand. And it was over the course of moments like this, that kind of patience and love, and I realized that I was in love with him.\u201d",

      "description": "The concept of mortality has maintained a persistent presence in my mind this year, as friends cope with serious illness in their families; as tragedies, both momentary and sustained, rage on throughout the world; as ugliness reveals itself more than we thought possible; and as prominent, beloved cultural figures in our lives pass away. One of those figures we lost was David Bowie, and no one dealt with their own mortality quite like the Starman.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, David Bowie\u2019s 69th birthday, he released what would be his last record, Blackstar. On January 10, 2016, Bowie passed away of liver cancer, an illness that no one but his closest confidants knew he even had. All of a sudden, Blackstar took on new meaning \u2014 or rather, we realized the meaning it had all along but had collectively failed to recognize. The album\u2019s standout, \u201cLazarus,\u201d became especially purposeful. Musically, \u201cLazarus\u201d is entrancing with it\u2019s round, full bass line and moaning saxophones. It sounds incredible, inspired, vital. Even at age 69, the man\u2019s creative juices were fully intact. The lyrics are full of allusions to his illness and impending passing: \u201cLook up here, I\u2019m in heaven. I\u2019ve got scars that can\u2019t be seen.\u201d No one exuded more life than Bowie, which is why such a debilitating illness must have eaten at him. Bowie is already looking forward to the freedom soon to come: \u201cThis way or no way, you know I\u2019ll be free, just like that bluebird. Ain\u2019t that just like me?\u201d\n\nDavid Bowie was a beacon of light in a world full of turmoil. Somehow, you could tell by the perpetual glint in his eye that he was aware of everything and always knew exactly what he was doing, artistically or otherwise, and the effect it would have. With \u201cLazarus,\u201d he determined the narrative of his own death; he went out on his own terms. And really, we shouldn\u2019t have expected anything less. Even in death, David Bowie was the coolest person on the planet.",
