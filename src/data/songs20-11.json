It combines different styles of from the annals of rock n&#39; roll history &#39; namely of the &#39;hard,&#39; &#39;pop,&#39; and &#39;arena&#39; varieties &#39; to create a treasure of a song that I would have loved to drive around to in high school.",

      "description": "<p>A while ago, a friend of mine asked me who makes more &#39;anthemic&#39; songs, Taylor Swift or Lorde? This was before Lorde&#39;s exquisite <i>Melodrama</i> came out this year, but after the lead single, &#39;Green Light,&#39; was released. Her celebrated debut album from 2013, <i>Pure Heroine</i>, was exceptional, full of quietly encouraging, relatable songs, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily characterize it as anthemic. Swift may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but singles like &#39;22,&#39; &#39;I Knew You Were Trouble,&#39; and &#39;Bad Blood&#39; are as conducive to late-night, impromptu sing-alongs as anything. So, after judging their musical output as a whole, my answer was Taylor Swift. BUT, I clarified that on a song-by-song basis, the most anthemic track either of them had ever done is easily Lorde&#39;s &#39;Green Light.&#39;</p><p>I was immediately taken aback by &#39;Green Light.&#39; It is <i>very</i> poppy in a reach-for-the-stars kind of way, which is not what I expected from Lorde and her more brooding, subtle style. But the more I heard it, the more the various parts stuck with me, like that enticing rhythmic piano in the lead-up to the chorus, or Lorde&#39;s pitch-perfect lyrics, like her sneer directed at an ex -- &#39;She says you love the beach, you&#39;re such a damn liar.&#39;</p> <p>Previously, Lorde had deftly straddled the line between electro-indie and pop in a way that was unique at the time. So to hear &#39;Green Light,&#39; which is very much a full-fledged pop song, was a bit jarring at first. But the thing is, &#39;Green Light&#39; is meant to aim big, and it succeeds tremendously. Taylor Swift has written timeless anthems, but if I were to drive around with the windows down late at night with friends, the first song I would want to hear is &#39;Green Light.&#39;</p>",

Julie Byrne, from Buffalo, New York, breaks the mold with songs that are crystal clear and deeply affecting. &#39;Natural Blue&#39; is so peaceful and serene, with just the right amount of atmospheric touches and strings complementing Byrne&#39;s delicately picked guitar and beautiful, understated voice, singing &#39;And when I first saw you, the sky, it was such a natural blue.&#39;",

      "description": "Melina Duterte, the Oakland-based 22-year-old who goes by Jay Som, is a gem. Her talent shines through on &#39;The Bus Song,&#39; where she writes, plays, and produces every sound you hear. It&#39;s a self-assured, nuanced, excellent song, intimate in both its sound and sentiment. I love when musicians adeptly bring different instruments in and out of a song, and Duterte is a master. She relies on a base level of drums, bass, guitar, and her soft, compelling voice, but occasionally brings in a piano, trumpet, and flute when it counts. My favorite moment is when she strips all the beautiful layers away for just a second at 2:33 &#39; the drums and other instruments drop out at just the right moment, when Duterte sings &#39;And I just want you to neeeeed me.&#39;",

      "description": "The xx expanded their sound in 2017, bolstering their more minimal style and coming closer to the larger feel of Jamie xx&#39;s solo material. &#39;Dangerous&#39; has an irresistible club feel, built around a seductive bass line, pulsing drums, and a blaring synth-trumpet riff. The way Jamie xx deploys different sounds is marvelous, especially at 2:49, when everything drops out except the bass and drum machine, and the trumpets slowly fade in, crescendoing to a great climax. &#39;Dangerous&#39; is easily the best dance song of the year, perfect for a late night and a good time.",

      "description": "After long last, including a stint at Columbia University, Robin Pecknold and the rest of the Fleet Foxes released their third album <i>Crack-Up</i> in 2017. It continues their career trajectory beginning with the simple structures of their debut self-titled album in 2008 (<i>Fleet Foxes</i>, featuring the well-known <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQRS40OKNE'>&#39;White Winter Hymnal&#39;</a>) and giving way to the more complex, but still thoroughly melodic <i>Helplessness Blues</i> in 2011. &#39;Third of May/_daigahara&#39; furthers the mission of <i>Helplessness Blues</i>, rich with an intricate soundscape and meandering melody. It brims with sweeping strings, quick changes from loud to soft (and back again), and a bit of grandeur, as Pecknold sings about <a target='_blank' href='https://genius.com/Fleet-foxes-third-of-may-odaigahara-lyrics'>&#39;an unresolved, unrequited relationship&#39;</a> with his bandmate during their time apart. My favorite line appears midway through, during an intense moment with a swirling current of strings, as Pecknold sings, &#39;Can I be light and free? If I lead you through the fury, will you call to me?&#39; &#39;Third of May/_daigahara&#39; is confident, unbelievable gorgeous, and full of surprises at every turn.",
