     "description": "Ryan Adams's recent full-blown embrace of 1980s anthem rock has led to some pretty excellent music in the last few years, starting with 2014's self-titled album and continuing with his <a target='_blank' href='https://dbradmusic.com/2015/09/25/poptimism-won-2015-who-won-1989/'>front-to-back cover of Taylor Swift's <i>1989</i></a>. 'Do You Still Love Me?' is another mid-tempo, heartland rocker that starts and stops with bursts of guitar and floating organ lines, building to a very satisfying chorus. It's like Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Foreigner all wrapped into a delicious package. I would have loved this as a classic-rock-obsessed high-schooler. The song does not qualify as original or challenging in any sense of those words, but sometimes you just need to relax with some comfort food.",

     "description": "<p>Sometimes there's WAY too much gimmicky news about Father John Misty (n' Josh Tillman), whether it's explaining in a somewhat unbearable manner <a target='_blank' href='http://www.stereogum.com/1924180/father-john-misty-i-will-ride-for-nickelback/news/'>why he likes a Nickelback song</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.stereogum.com/1841416/father-john-misty-teaches-you-how-to-stop-dressing-like-a-graphic-designer/news/'>musings on fashion</a>, or just admitting that he can <a target='_blank' href='http://www.stereogum.com/1929879/father-john-misty-talks-microdosing-pop-music-and-being-kind-of-annoying/news/'>be kind of annoying</a> in yet another interview. But if that's the price we must pay for his undeniable talent, then it's worth it. Tillman's latest album, <i>Pure Comedy</i>, goes heavy on mid-tempo ballads and low on variety, but every song is executed so beautifully, complete with his expectedly clever lyrics and his amazing voice. Seriously though, that voice. I'll venture to say that it's the most beautiful voice currently in indie, and certainly one of the top 10 voices in all of music right now.</p><p>'Ballad of the Dying Man' sounds a lot like an Elton John song, except with a heavy dose of sarcastic wit. It tells the tale of a man who spends his life self-importantly critiquing the world, but laments the fact that his imminent death means he'll no longer get to grace us with his opinions. The dying man sings 'Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok / And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked.' The last verse is particularly thought-provoking, as the man realizes he's maybe not as all-knowing as he thought: 'Eventually the dying man takes his final breath / But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss / And it occurs to him a little late in the game / We leave as clueless as we came.'</p><p>It's all pretty hilarious and hits the nail on the head when it comes to describing our collective obsession with sharing everything we think on social media, regardless of whether anyone else cares or not. The music itself is beautiful, ending with a particularly gorgeous chorus of 'ohhs' and 'ahh's from a gospel choir. Tillman can be a tad insufferable, but man if he isn't smart and incredibly skilled at making music.</p>",

'raingurl' is just a straight-up bleary-eyed blast, with a deep bass-heavy beat that is currently causing me to dance around the house in between writing these sentences. Yaeji sing-raps in both English and Korean, trading off until the instantly memorable chorus, where she says, 'Mother Russia in my cup / And my glasses fogging up / Oh yeah, hey dog, hey what's up / (Oh yeah, hey dog, hey what's up),' followed by 'When the sweaty walls are banging / I don't f--- with family planning / Make it rain gurl, make it rain.' It's amazing. Someday before I die, I want to hear this song in a club or at a dance party late at night and go crazy.",

'Super Natural' sounds a bit like Real Estate, with its lilting, ringing guitars, but with a slightly more direct confrontation of emotion in its sound. The lyrics are as alluringly wistful as you would imagine, like when he sings 'I don't know how but I can say that I found my religion / When nothing was ahead of us that week in California.' This is the kind of low-key song that doesn't get a lot of exposure, but absolutely should, because it has the ability to appeal to a lot of people with diverse tastes.",

The song is built on an insanely catchy drum beat and bass line, with that punchy five-note guitar riff punctuating the song throughout. There's even a guitar solo! Matt Berninger's comforting baritone, the one we know and love, is present here, but my favorite part is when he passionately raises his voice an octave, exclaiming 'I cannot explain it, ahh-ahhh, any other, any other way!'

This characterization is working, because reviewers called <i>More Life</i> the best project Drake has done in years. That's an exaggeration ' the 'playlist' certainly boasts some great highlights, but they're surrounded by a glut of mid-tempo filler.</p><p>'Passionfruit' is the highest of those highlights. It will never cease to amaze me how Drake, when he's on his game, can be so good at rap and also so good at pop/R&B.

     "description": "Cloud Nothings started out as an indie pop band before turning it up to eleven on one of the best albums of the decade, 2012's hard-rocking and intense <i>Attack on Memory</i>. Frontman Dylan Baldi goes back to draw from his pop roots on <i>Life Without Sound</i>, the band's fifth full-length, but maintains the edge he's gained in the years since. 'Enter Entirely' kind of sounds like 90's Weezer, but darker and a little more introspective. My absolute favorite part starts at 2:58 goes all the way through to the end ' I'm honestly obsessed with it. After riding a great groove, Baldi leaves just an understated guitar and a few snare hits, while singing 'Moving on, but I still feel it / You're just a light in me now.' He repeats the lyric multiple times as he brings the full band back in, building to an incredible climax.",
